Based on the above insights, a reversal from the current downtrend to an uptrend is expected. 

### Price Forces

According to **price action theory**, the following must occur for the reversal to happen:

- **Narrow Rotations near Zone's High**  
  Although this has yet occurred, there are narrow rotations (blue box) near **August 07 - September 06, 2024**. The price will likely consolidate around 60k - 64k.

- **Price Rotation Around Control Level**  
  Price tends to rotate around the control price (the level where the most trading activity has occurred). It's unlikely the price will fall below the control price, which is 57k.
