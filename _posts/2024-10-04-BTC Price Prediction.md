## Prediction Scenarios

Only these two scenarios are likely to happen:

1. **Price Consolidation**  
   The price consolidates around 60k - 64k until **November 05**.
   
2. **Price Retrace and Move Upward**  
   The price retraces back to 57k at most, then moves upward again until **November 05**.

## Macroeconomic Insights

There's a high probability that the bull market will start from **November 05** for the following reasons:

- **Global Fiat Money Supply Increase**  
  Many countries are currently cutting rates, leading to an increase in fiat supply. (e.g. China Stimulus package)

- **Geopolitical Tensions**  
  Escalating geopolitical events, such as Iran-Israel conflicts.
  
- **Whale Accumulation**  
  The highest buying spree by new whales in the last 10 years, indicating significant accumulation. Note that, accumulation speed is more faster compared to 2020.

- **Historical Trends**  
  The bull market typically begins after elections, regardless of who wins. Investors prefer waiting for these events to pass before entering risk assets like BTC.

- **BTC Long-term Fundamentals**  
  The stock-to-flow (S2F) model is reaching a critical inflection point, signaling a likely transition to an uptrend. The S2F is the most accurate model (I believe) for long-term BTC movement as it accounts for halvings, which drive value higher over time.

## Price Reversal Expectation

Based on the above insights, a reversal from the current downtrend to an uptrend is expected. 

### Price Forces

According to **price action theory**, the following must occur for the reversal to happen:

- **Narrow Rotations near Zone's High**  
  Although this has yet occured, but a prior signal has occured as there are narrow rotations (blue box) near **August 07 - September 06, 2024**. Since narrow rotations near zone's high must occur, price consolidate around 60k - 64k 

- **Price Rotation Around Control Level**  
  We know that price have a tendency to rotate around control price (the level where the most trading activity has occurred). And, based on previous macroeconomic trends, it is unlikely that the price will go below this control price, which is 57k.

### Worst Case Scenarios

In the worst case, either of the two predicted scenarios will unfold:
1. Price consolidates around 60k - 64k.
2. Price retraces to 57k, then moves upward.
