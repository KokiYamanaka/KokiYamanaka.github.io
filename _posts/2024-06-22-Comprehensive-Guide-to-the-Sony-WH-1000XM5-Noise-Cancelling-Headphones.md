The Sony WH-1000XM5, the latest flagship noise-cancelling headphones, feature two processors controlling eight microphones for advanced noise cancellation. They also have a smart feature that dynamically adjusts noise-cancelling settings based on the environment.

The product features a sleek and soft-texture design. Dimensions are 9.7 x 8.6 x 2.9 inches (height x width x depth). It weighs 250 grams. The color is available in black, silver, and midnight blue. The headband is designed to be extremely thick with high-density foam.


## Noise Cancelling System Components

The noise cancelling system consists of five main working parts:

1. Microphone
2. Processor
3. Noise Cancellation Algorithm
4. Auto NC Optimizer
5. Speaker driver

### Microphone

The microphone is an electronic device that receives sounds and converts them into electrical signals, allowing computers to recognize them. The microphone in the Sony WH-1000XM5 is golden and black, weighs 0.04 grams, and is made of silicon. Dimensions: 2.75 x 1.85 x 0.90 mm.

### Processor

The processor is an electronic component that processes digital information. It is square-shaped with a dimension of 5 x 5 mm and has a black metallic outer layer. It communicates with and instructs other electronic components such as the speaker driver and microphones. The processor receives ambient sound waves picked up by the microphone and instructs the noise cancellation algorithm to process these sound waves.

### Noise Cancellation Algorithm

The noise cancellation algorithm reduces unwanted ambient sounds by generating sound waves that are the exact opposite (inverted) of the incoming noise. This process is crucial for creating silent noise within the ear cups.

#### Steps:

1. Receival: The algorithm receives the external sound waves.
2. Recognition: The sound waves are analyzed by the algorithm to recognize the ambient sound waves.
3. Generation: The algorithm generates the exact opposite of the ambient waves.
4. Cancellation: The ambient waves meet the generated waves, canceling each other out to create silence within the ear cups.

electronics within the headphones to generate an inverse signal (blue waves). When the external noise
and the headphone signal meet, they cancel each other out, resulting in silence within the ear cups* 
### Auto NC Optimizer

The Auto NC Optimizer enhances noise-cancelling performance by automatically adjusting to surroundings and wearing conditions. It works as an assistant to the noise cancellation algorithm.

#### Detections:

- Ambient noise
- Air pressure
- Headphone positioning


### Speaker Driver

The speaker driver converts electrical signals into sound. It has a circular shape with a diameter of 30mm, coated with bronze metallic on the outer part and transparent plastic on the inner part. The driver works closely with the noise-cancelling algorithm to produce the sound.

## Parts Operation

The Sony WH-1000XM5 employs Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) to receive ambient noises, emit opposite noises, and cancel the noise. The process:

1. Microphones receive ambient noises.
2. Processor processes the noises and instructs the noise-cancelling algorithm.
3. Algorithm creates an electrical signal opposite to the ambient sound.
4. Auto NC Optimizer aids in enhancing the performance.
5. Speaker Driver produces the inverted sound to cancel ambient sound.

This advanced noise-cancelling system is ideal for concentrating in crowded workplaces, listening to music without interruptions, and traveling without vehicle noises.
